 * Custom ESM shim plugin wrapper that respects user-declared __filename/__dirname variables.
 *
 * The original @rollup/plugin-esm-shim would inject shims even when users had already declared
 * their own __filename/__dirname, causing "Identifier '__filename' has already been declared" errors.
 *
 * This wrapper checks if the user has already declared these variables and skips the shim injection
 * if so. If either variable is declared, we skip the shim entirely since the original plugin injects
 * both together and we assume users who declare one will also handle the other if needed.
